###for openstreetmap
Download ros2 foxy, and webots. 
then open street maps.com and crop the map and save as .osm
git clone https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/resources/osm_importer
open osm fle change something in JOSM and save it again as .osm.
then open importer.py script with input output arguments.
and it is convertor to .wbt and now open in webots the wbt map

###Webots Autonomous Car Workflow and wrote the scipt to p√ºublish if camera is publsih or not as 1 or 0.

    Set Up the Environment:
        Install Webots, ROS2 (e.g., Foxy), and any necessary dependencies.
        Configure your environment variables like $PYTHONPATH and $WEBOTS_HOME as needed.

    Create the Map and Add Sensors in Webots:
        Open Webots and load a prebuilt world (e.g., city.wbt) or create a custom map.
        Add your car to the world from the Webots robot library.
        Attach sensors like camera, lidar, IMU, GPS, etc., to the car:
            Configure the placement and properties of the sensors using the Webots Scene Tree.

    Write a Controller Script:
        Create a Python script for your car (e.g., camera_status_publisher.py).
        Use Webots' API (controller library) to access sensor data and implement your logic.
        If you're integrating with ROS2, use rclpy to publish sensor data and subscribe to topics for control commands.
        Example: For the camera, you learned today how to publish 1 when the camera is functional.

    Set the Controller to <extern>:
        Open the Webots Scene Tree and set the car's controller field to <extern>. This allows you to manually run the controller script externally, giving you more control.

    Automate Controller Execution with a Shell Script:
        Create a shell script (e.g., start_controller.sh) to simplify running the controller script:

#!/bin/bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
export WEBOTS_HOME=/snap/webots/current/usr/share/webots
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/ros/foxy/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$WEBOTS_HOME/webots-controller /path/to/camera_status_publisher.py

Make the script executable:

chmod +x start_controller.sh

Run the script:

    ./start_controller.sh

Run the Webots Simulation:

    Start the Webots simulation by clicking the Play button.
    Ensure the car behaves as expected (e.g., the camera is publishing data).

Visualize and Debug Using ROS2 Tools:

    Use rqt and rviz2 to visualize and debug:
        Example:

        ros2 topic echo /camera_status
        ros2 topic list
        rqt

Extend Functionality:

    Add other modules (e.g., lidar processing, localization, path planning, and control) as needed.
